# Backend Programming Languages

## Learning Objectives
- Write server applications in multiple languages
- Understand language-specific paradigms
- Handle async programming and concurrency
- Implement error handling and logging
- Use language-specific libraries and frameworks
- Deploy applications for production

## Core Topics
1. **Node.js & JavaScript**
   - Async patterns (Promises, async/await)
   - Module system and npm ecosystem
   - Stream processing
   - Event emitters

2. **Python**
   - Type hints and protocols
   - Decorators and metaclasses
   - Virtual environments and packaging
   - Asyncio and async frameworks

3. **Java**
   - Object-oriented principles
   - Collections and streams
   - Concurrency and threading
   - Build tools (Maven, Gradle)

4. **Go**
   - Goroutines and channels
   - Interfaces and composition
   - Error handling patterns
   - Package management

5. **Rust**
   - Ownership and borrowing
   - Pattern matching
   - Trait system
   - Error handling (Result, Option)

6. **PHP**
   - Object-oriented PHP
   - Autoloading and namespaces
   - Composer and package management
   - Modern PHP standards

## Projects
- REST API server in chosen language
- Microservice implementation
