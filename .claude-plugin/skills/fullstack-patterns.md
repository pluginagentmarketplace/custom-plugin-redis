# Full-Stack Architecture & Patterns

## Learning Objectives
- Design scalable full-stack applications
- Implement comprehensive authentication
- Manage API contracts between frontend/backend
- Handle data consistency
- Optimize performance end-to-end
- Manage monorepo or microservices

## Core Topics
1. **Architecture Patterns**
   - MVC and modern variations
   - Server-side vs client-side rendering
   - API-first architecture
   - Microservices vs monolith
   - Event-driven architecture

2. **Authentication & Authorization**

   - Session management
   - RBAC and ABAC
   - Token refresh strategies

3. **API Design**
   - REST best practices
   - GraphQL implementation
   - API versioning
   - Rate limiting
   - Documentation with OpenAPI

4. **Data Management**
   - Cache invalidation
   - Optimistic updates
   - Data consistency
   - Pagination and filtering
   - Transactions

5. **DevOps Integration**
   - Infrastructure as code
   - Containerization
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Error tracking

## Projects
- Complete e-commerce platform
- Real-time collaboration app
- Multi-tenant SaaS
- Mobile app backend
- GraphQL server with frontend

## Assessment
- Design full-stack system
