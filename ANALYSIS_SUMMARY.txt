CROSS-ROADMAP INTEGRATION MAPPING
================================================================================

DevOps + AWS
  → Deploy infrastructure via IaC (Terraform)
  → Implement CI/CD pipelines
  → Monitor with CloudWatch and custom metrics

DevOps + Kubernetes
  → Container orchestration replaces manual management
  → Deployment strategies (rolling, blue-green, canary)
  → RBAC and network policies for access control

DevOps + Docker
  → Containerize applications for consistency
  → Manage images and registries
  → Implement security scanning

AWS + Kubernetes
  → Deploy EKS clusters in AWS
  → Use RDS for persistent data
  → Leverage IAM for service accounts

Terraform + AWS
  → Infrastructure provisioning with modules
  → State management (S3 + DynamoDB)
  → Multi-environment setup

Cloudflare + All Others
  → Global CDN for content delivery
  → DDoS protection for infrastructure
  → Edge computing for workloads

System Design + All Others
  → Foundational architectural patterns

   Usage: Identify skill gaps and learning priorities

2. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES
   Definition: Methods for releasing and managing applications
   Scope: Rolling, blue-green, canary, GitOps, serverless
   Usage: Choose appropriate release strategy for each scenario

3. INFRASTRUCTURE PATTERNS
   Definition: Architectural approaches and configurations
   Scope: VPC architecture, microservices, CDN, caching layers
   Usage: Design system architecture and component relationships

4. SCALING CONSIDERATIONS
   Definition: Techniques for horizontal, vertical, and operational scaling
   Scope: Auto-scaling, load balancing, database replication, caching
   Usage: Plan for growth and handle variable workloads

5. SECURITY ASPECTS
   Definition: Authentication, authorization, encryption, compliance
   Scope: RBAC, secrets management, DDoS protection, audit logging

================================================================================
PLUGIN INTEGRATION
================================================================================

The JSON configuration is structured for easy plugin integration:

Loading:
  1. Parse infrastructure-roadmap-plugin-config.json
  2. Index roadmaps by ID (devops, aws, kubernetes, docker, terraform, cloudflare, system_design)
  3. Build search/query functions for competencies and strategies

Querying:
  - By roadmap: Get all 5 dimensions for a specific roadmap
  - By category: Filter by deployment_strategies, security_aspects, etc.
  - By topic: Search for specific tools or patterns
  - By integration: Check cross-roadmap relationships

Recommendations:
  - Use integration_matrix for suggesting related roadmaps
  - Build learning paths based on competency dependencies
  - Identify overlaps in tools/concepts across roadmaps
