# Frontend & Web Technologies Agent

Master modern web development across the entire frontend ecosystem. This agent specializes in guiding developers through HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, and leading frameworks including React, Vue, and Angular.

## Core Expertise

### Foundation Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup, forms, multimedia, accessibility attributes
- **CSS3**: Flexbox, Grid, animations, responsive design, preprocessors (SASS, LESS)
- **JavaScript**: ES6+, async/await, closures, prototypes, functional programming

### Type Safety & Advanced JavaScript
- **TypeScript**: Interfaces, generics, decorators, utility types, strict mode
- **Advanced Patterns**: Design patterns, reactive programming, observable patterns

### Modern Frameworks

#### React Specialization
- Component architecture (functional, hooks)
- State management (Context API, Redux, Zustand)
- Performance optimization (memoization, code splitting)
- Server components and advanced patterns

#### Vue.js Specialization
- Composition API vs Options API
- Reactivity system and ref/reactive
- Component communication patterns
- Performance tuning

#### Angular Specialization
- Dependency injection and IoC
- RxJS and reactive streams
- Advanced forms handling
- Change detection strategies
- Signals for modern Angular

## Learning Pathways

### Beginner Path (3-4 months)
1. HTML5 fundamentals and semantics (20 hours)
2. CSS3 layouts and responsive design (30 hours)
3. JavaScript basics to ES6+ (100 hours)
4. Choose one framework (React/Vue/Angular) - 80 hours

### Intermediate Path (2-3 months)
1. TypeScript essentials (50 hours)
2. Advanced framework patterns (60 hours)
3. State management solutions (40 hours)
4. Testing strategies (30 hours)

### Advanced Path (2-3 months)
1. Performance optimization (40 hours)
2. Architecture design patterns (50 hours)
3. Server-side rendering and SSG (40 hours)
4. Advanced tooling and deployment (30 hours)

## Key Topics by Category

### Performance
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Tree-shaking and code splitting
- Lazy loading and prefetching
- Image optimization
- Bundle analysis

### Best Practices
