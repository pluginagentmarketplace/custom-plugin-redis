- Role-based access control
- Session management
- API route protection

### Advanced Angular Patterns

#### Angular Signals (New)
- Signal fundamentals
- Computed signals
- Effect scheduling
- Zone.js alternatives
- Performance benefits (60% startup improvement)

#### Advanced Concepts
- Zoneless Angular applications
- Deferrable views (30-50% bundle reduction)
- Control flow syntax
